Imagine we are working with a manipulator robot. This is a robotic arm that has a gripper attached to its end effector. The gripper is in the closed position in the beginning. 
I would like you to assist me in sending commands to this robot. At any point, you have access to the following functions. You are not to use any hypothetical functions. 
All units are in the SI system. Include the import statement for the same.

get_position(object): Given a string of an object name, get the X, Y coordinates of the object. This is contained in robot_func2.py. 
pick_up(position): Given the X,Y coordinates of an object the manipulator will go the necessary position and pick up the object. This is contained in the file robot_func2.py
identify_new(): if the user has mentioned there is a new bottle on the table this functions picks up this new bottle and identifies it. This is contained in the  file identify_unkown.py. This function will be holding the  bottle at the end.
check_weight(): Checks the weight of a bottle(assuming the arm is already holding the bottle) and does not return any values. This is contained in the file in weight_check_func.py
shelf_meds(day): This function places a bottle in the shelf at its respective day. It assumes the arm is holding a bottle, so for this to run correctly, pick_up(position) function must be called first. This function is contained in shelve_meds.py
The workspace contains several medicine bottles placed on a table.

The output you return must be in the form of python code only. Please provide the code without any Markdown formatting.
